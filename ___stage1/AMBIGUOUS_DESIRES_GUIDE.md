# 🎯 Ambiguous Desires Architecture Guide

The Ambiguous Desires Architecture is a revolutionary enhancement to forest.os that handles evolving and unclear learning goals through progressive clarification, intelligent convergence detection, and adaptive HTA evolution.

## 🌟 Core Components

### 1. **Clarification Dialogue System**
Interactive goal refinement through targeted questioning that helps users discover their true learning desires.

### 2. **Goal Convergence Detection**
Pattern recognition that analyzes user responses and learning behavior to identify when goals are becoming clearer or when pivots occur.

### 3. **Adaptive HTA Evolution**
Advanced strategy evolution that can rewrite goals, manage uncertainty, and rebuild learning trees as understanding emerges.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Assess Goal Clarity
Before starting any project, assess if your goal needs clarification:

```bash
assess_goal_clarity_forest --goal "I want to get better at programming"
```

**Example Response:**
```
🎯 Goal Clarity Assessment

Goal: I want to get better at programming

Clarity Level: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
Uncertainty: 75%

Uncertain Areas: specificity, domain_focus, outcome
Summary: Goal has 3 uncertain areas: specificity, domain_focus, outcome
Recommendation: High clarification priority

*Consider using start_clarification_dialogue_forest to refine your goal.*
```

### Start Clarification Dialogue
For ambiguous goals, begin an interactive clarification session:

```bash
start_clarification_dialogue_forest --ambiguous_goal "I want to get better at programming" --context "I'm interested in technology but not sure what direction"
```

**Example Response:**
```
🔍 Goal Clarification Dialogue Started

Original Goal: I want to get better at programming

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Complete Beginner
```bash
# 1. Assess unclear goal
assess_goal_clarity_forest --goal "I want to learn technology"

# 2. Start clarification dialogue
start_clarification_dialogue_forest --ambiguous_goal "I want to learn technology"

# 3. Continue dialogue through multiple rounds
