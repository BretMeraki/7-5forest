#### Step 1: Create a Project (1 minute)
**Say**: "Let's say you want to learn photography and build an Instagram following"
**Show**: Create project with realistic details
**Highlight**: "Notice how it asks about your energy patterns, constraints, and learning style"

#### Step 2: Generate Learning Strategy (1.5 minutes)  
**Say**: "Watch this - it's going to analyze the complexity and create a strategic plan"
**Run**: build_hta_tree_forest
**Highlight**: "Look at this - it created Foundation â†’ Research â†’ Capability â†’ Implementation â†’ Mastery phases, with specific tasks for each"

#### Step 3: Get Personalized Next Action (1 minute)
**Say**: "Now it knows exactly what you should work on next"
**Run**: get_next_task_forest with current energy/time
**Highlight**: "It considers your energy level, available time, and where you are in the journey"

#### Step 4: Show Adaptive Intelligence (1.5 minutes)
**Say**: "Here's the magic - watch how it adapts when I tell it about my progress"
**Run**: evolve_strategy_forest with breakthrough feedback
**Highlight**: "It just evolved the strategy based on my actual learning - adding more advanced tasks automatically"

### 4. **The Wow Factor** (30 seconds)
"This isn't just a task manager - it's like having a learning strategist who knows you personally and adapts to how you actually learn and progress."
