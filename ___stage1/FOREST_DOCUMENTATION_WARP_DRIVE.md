## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Tools not available in Claude**
- **Solution**: Ensure `core-server.js` is running and Claude Desktop has MCP server configured
- **Check**: `list_projects_forest` should return available projects

**2. Vector database connection issues**
- **Solution**: System automatically falls back to local JSON storage
- **Check**: Look for "Vector store unavailable, using local fallback" in logs

**3. Memory sync issues**
- **Solution**: Run `sync_forest_memory_forest` to rebuild memory state
- **Check**: Verify data directory permissions

**4. Strategy evolution not working**
- **Solution**: Ensure project has active HTA tree built
- **Check**: Run `get_hta_status_forest` to verify tree exists

### Debug Commands

```bash
# System health check
node scripts/validate-vector-integration.js

# Check all projects
list_projects_forest

# Verify tool availability
ask_truthful_claude_forest --query "What tools are available?"

# Full status check
current_status_forest
