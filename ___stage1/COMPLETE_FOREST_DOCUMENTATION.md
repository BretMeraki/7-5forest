## 🔄 Factory Reset System

### Overview

The Factory Reset System provides secure, controlled methods to reset project data and restore the system to a clean state. This powerful tool is designed with multiple safety layers to prevent accidental data loss while enabling efficient project management.

### Safety Features

**Multi-Layer Protection**:
- **Explicit Confirmation Required**: All reset operations require meaningful confirmation messages
- **Preview Mode**: See exactly what will be deleted before proceeding
- **Selective Reset**: Choose between single project or full system reset
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing approach ensures data consistency
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of all reset operations

**Confirmation Process**:
- Human-readable confirmation messages generated by AI
- Clear explanation of consequences before execution
- Timeout protection against accidental confirmations
- Detailed preview of affected data

### Available Commands

#### Core Reset Operations

```bash
# Full system factory reset (all projects)
factory_reset_forest
  --confirm "I understand this will permanently delete all Forest projects and data"

# Single project reset
factory_reset_forest
  --project_id "my_project_123"
  --confirm "I want to permanently delete the project 'my_project_123' and all its data"

# Quick reset (bypass confirmation - use with extreme caution)
factory_reset_forest
  --project_id "test_project"
  --force_confirm true
```

#### Preview and Safety Commands

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted (recommended before reset)
get_factory_reset_preview_forest
  --project_id "my_project_123"  # Optional: omit for full system preview

# Get confirmation dialog for review
get_factory_reset_confirmation_forest
  --project_id "my_project_123"  # Optional: omit for full system confirmation
```

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Safe Single Project Reset

```bash
# Step 1: Preview what will be deleted
get_factory_reset_preview_forest --project_id "old_project"

# Step 2: Get confirmation message
get_factory_reset_confirmation_forest --project_id "old_project"

# Step 3: Execute reset with proper confirmation
factory_reset_forest 
  --project_id "old_project"
  --confirm "I understand this will permanently delete the 'old_project' including all tasks, memory, and learning progress"
```

#### Example 2: Full System Reset

```bash
# Step 1: Preview all projects that will be deleted
get_factory_reset_preview_forest

# Step 2: Get system-wide confirmation message
get_factory_reset_confirmation_forest

# Step 3: Execute full reset
factory_reset_forest 
  --confirm "I understand this will permanently delete ALL Forest projects and reset the system to factory defaults"
```

#### Example 3: Development/Testing Reset

```bash
# Quick reset for development (bypass confirmation)
factory_reset_forest 
  --project_id "test_project"
  --force_confirm true

# Verify reset completed
list_projects_forest
```

### What Gets Reset

**Single Project Reset**:
- Project configuration and metadata
- All HTA (Hierarchical Task Analysis) trees
- Learning progress and memory
- Task completion history
- Generated schedules and plans
- Project-specific vector embeddings
- Cached data and temporary files

**Full System Reset**:
- All individual projects (as above)
- Global system configuration
- Cross-project memory and insights
- System-wide caches and indexes
- All vector database entries
- System logs and analytics

### Technical Implementation

**Architecture**:
- **Orchestrator**: `forest-learning-orchestrator.js` - Main factory reset logic
- **Project Management**: `project-management.js` - Project lifecycle handling
- **Data Persistence**: `data-persistence.js` - Atomic data operations
- **Memory Sync**: `memory-sync.js` - Memory state management

**Key Methods**:
- `factoryReset()` - Main reset orchestration
- `resetSingleProject()` - Single project reset logic
- `resetAllProjects()` - Full system reset logic
- `getFactoryResetPreview()` - Preview affected data
- `handleFactoryResetConfirmation()` - Confirmation flow management

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Partial reset recovery on system failures
- Detailed error reporting with recovery suggestions
- Atomic operations ensure no partial state corruption
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Common Error Scenarios**:
- **Permission Issues**: Clear guidance on file system permissions
- **Active Project Lock**: Automatic cleanup of locked resources
- **Vector Database Errors**: Graceful fallback to local cleanup
- **Network Failures**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

### Best Practices

**Before Reset**:
1. **Export Important Data**: Use export tools to backup valuable insights
2. **Review Preview**: Always check what will be deleted
3. **Verify Project Status**: Ensure no critical work is in progress
4. **Test Confirmation**: Use preview mode to understand the scope

**During Reset**:
1. **Avoid Interruption**: Let the process complete fully
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any error messages
3. **Check Progress**: Use status commands to verify completion

**After Reset**:
1. **Verify Cleanup**: Confirm all intended data was removed
2. **Restart Services**: Restart core-server.js if needed
3. **Create New Projects**: Set up fresh projects as needed
4. **Test Functionality**: Verify system is working correctly

### Security Considerations

**Data Protection**:
- **No Recovery**: Reset operations are permanent and irreversible
- **Confirmation Required**: Multiple confirmation layers prevent accidents
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all reset operations
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can perform resets

**Production Safety**:
- **Backup Strategy**: Always backup before major resets
- **Staged Rollout**: Test on development environments first
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for reset operations
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of reset procedures
