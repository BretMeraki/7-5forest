# Adaptive Branch Generation Examples

## The Problem with Generic Branching
The old rigid system: **Foundation ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Capability ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Mastery**

This works poorly for diverse goals because:
- ‚ùå A chef doesn't need a "Research" phase to learn cooking
- ‚ùå A fitness goal doesn't follow academic progression  
- ‚ùå A business venture starts with market validation, not theory
- ‚ùå Creative projects need inspiration and experimentation phases

## Domain-Aware Adaptive Branching

## Key Advantages of Adaptive Branching

### ‚úÖ **Domain Respect**
- Creative goals get inspiration phases
- Technical goals get hands-on building
- Business goals get market validation
- Physical goals get habit formation

### ‚úÖ **Intent Awareness**  
- Career transitions focus on credibility and networking
- Passion projects emphasize exploration and fulfillment
- Problem solving prioritizes validation and testing
- Lifestyle changes focus on sustainability and habits

### ‚úÖ **Graceful Fallback**
- When domain detection fails, uses complexity-based branching
- Always generates sensible progression regardless of goal type
- Maintains domain-agnostic principles

### ‚úÖ **Contextual Intelligence**
- Same domain can have different progressions based on intent
- Branches reflect how experts actually approach the domain
- Natural learning flow that matches human psychology

This adaptive approach makes your HTA system truly domain-agnostic while still providing intelligent, contextual learning paths!
