# 7-2forest: Forest MCP Server (Fixed & Validated)

A domain-agnostic, intelligent project and task management system using Model Context Protocol (MCP) with advanced HTA (Hierarchical Task Analysis) trees, strategy evolution, and vector database integration.

## 🚀 Status: Production Ready

✅ **Server startup works cleanly** - All import issues resolved  
✅ **All validators pass** - 7/7 consolidation tests successful  
✅ **No functionality loss** - All 12 MCP tools fully operational  
✅ **Vector intelligence preserved** - Enhanced HTA and task selection  
✅ **Infrastructure stable** - Ready for development and deployment

## 🏗️ What Was Fixed

This repository contains the resolved version of the Forest MCP server that had ES module import compatibility issues. The key fixes include:

### Root Problems Solved:
- **ES Module Import Errors**: Fixed `StdioServerTransport`, `Server`, and `Client` import failures
- **SDK Compatibility Issues**: Resolved CommonJS/ES module conflicts with MCP SDK
- **Silent Validator Failures**: Validators now run successfully and provide output
- **Server Startup Crashes**: Clean startup without syntax errors

### Technical Solutions:
- **Local MCP Implementations**: Created working ES module replacements for problematic SDK components
- **Import Path Updates**: Fixed all module imports across the codebase
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features work exactly as before
- **Maintained Architecture**: Domain-agnostic design and vector intelligence intact

## 📦 Installation

npm install
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start the MCP Server

```

## 🧪 Validation Results

All tests pass successfully:

```
✅ Module Initialization (11ms)
✅ Core Tool Definitions (1ms)  
✅ Data Persistence (8ms)
✅ Project Management (4ms)
✅ HTA Core Functionality (96ms)
✅ Task Strategy Core (4ms)
✅ Memory Sync (2ms)

Total: 7/7 tests passed in 129ms
```
